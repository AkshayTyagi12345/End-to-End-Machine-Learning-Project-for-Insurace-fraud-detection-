In this example, we will be working with some auto insurance data to demonstrate how we can create a predictive model that predicts if an insurance claim is fraudulent or not. This will be a Binary Classification task, and we will be creating a Machine learning  model.

With the prediction data, we are able to estimate what our total predicted fradulent claim amount is like, and zoom into various features such as a breakdown of predicted fraud count by insured hobbies - our model's best predictor.

We will cover the following steps to illustrate how we build a Machine Learning Pipeline:

Data Import
Data Exploration
Data Processing
Create ML  Model
Measuring Error Rate
